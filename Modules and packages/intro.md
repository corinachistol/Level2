## Paradigm: nodejs, angular  (php,python.java)

Modules are JS files you can import to your project and benefit from it. All variables from modules are local, private , unless you export them all or particularly

Packages can be both a file and a folder full of files that contain the information about the project, configs, settings, source code, like a passport!

# NODEJS:
    -any script --> module / local scoping
    CommonJS:       require()
    ECMS Modules    import
